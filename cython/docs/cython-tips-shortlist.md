1. **Static Typing and Typecasting**
   - Use `cdef` for declaring C variables to speed up calculations.
   - Typecast variables as needed to reduce type-checking overhead.

2. **`cdef` Functions for Internal Use**
   - Use `cdef` for functions only called within Cython.
   - Use `cpdef` if you need the function accessible from both Python and Cython.

3. **Memory Views for Efficient Array Handling**
   - Use `numpy.ndarray` and memory views for large arrays and matrices to optimize access.

4. **Loop Optimizations**
   - Use `prange` (from `cython.parallel`) for parallel loops.
   - Release the GIL (`nogil=True`) in loops without Python objects.

5. **Use of `nogil` Contexts**
   - Use `with nogil` in sections that don’t need Python objects, allowing true multithreading.

6. **Inlined Functions with `inline`**
   - Use `inline` to avoid function call overhead for small, frequently used helper functions.

7. **Profiling and Performance Measurement**
   - Use `cython -a` to generate an annotated HTML report showing Python-to-C translations.
   - Compile with `profile=True` for profiling with Python’s `cProfile`.
